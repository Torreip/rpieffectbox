rpieffectbox
============

This repo contains the code and schematics for the Raspberry pi based guitar effect box built by Ben Jacobs of DoItNow Labs.

I eddited the code from "DoItNow Labs" to be able to test it without having the corresponding hardware. A very basic console menu is used instead.

There are paths to adapt in main.py and server.pd.
